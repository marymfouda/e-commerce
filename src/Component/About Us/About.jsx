    <p className="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5"  > In 2019, App-Annie released a report concerning collecting and analyzing app usage insights. The shopping sector has been the black horse of the race, as mobile apps reshaped the retail industry by becoming increasingly fast and easy to use. That’s why our skilled developers can build your eCommerce solution for both web and mobile apps, they can be controlled from the same control panel to make sure you reach the market's full potential on both platforms. Whether we develop your eCommerce backend on Magento (which we love) or develop it from scratch, we provide eCommerce projects with the needed APIs in a proper structure for integration with any mobile app technology.</p>

     <h2>Organizing your products</h2>
     <p>
     Shopify sorts the products you’re selling online into categories called collections. For example, you could put all of your t-shirts and sweaters in a "clothing" collection, while also having some of the same t-shirts in a "sales" collection.

You can also organize your products by using smart collections. Smart collections group products by conditions that you define. For example, you can create a smart collection that automatically gathers all products under $20 and present this smart collection as "Gift Ideas" to your customers.
